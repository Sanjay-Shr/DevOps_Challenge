# Day 26 | DevOps Challenge — Setting Up Linux Server on Virtual Machine

Today was a short but productive day as I focused on setting up a Linux server environment on my system using VirtualBox. I began by downloading the Linux Server ISO file and installing VirtualBox to create my virtual machine.

While setting up and starting the VM, I encountered an error related to AMD-V not being enabled because of a conflict with the KVM kernel module. It was unexpected, but troubleshooting it gave me a deeper understanding of how virtualization works and how kernel-level modules interact.

After performing a few configurations and managing virtualization modules, I successfully resolved the issue and was able to start the virtual machine without any problems. Once the VM booted up, I completed the setup for my Linux server environment.

This small challenge reminded me that DevOps often involves handling real-world setup errors and learning how to troubleshoot them effectively. Every environment setup teaches something new — and today’s lesson was all about understanding virtualization conflicts and kernel handling.

## Key Takeaways
1. Setting up virtualized Linux environments is a core DevOps skill.  
2. AMD-V or KVM module conflicts are common issues when running virtual machines.  
3. Understanding kernel-level modules helps with quick troubleshooting.  
4. A working Linux VM is an essential base for hands-on DevOps automation.  
5. Facing such real-world issues builds stronger problem-solving habits.

## Question
Have you ever faced any virtualization issues while setting up your own local DevOps lab?
