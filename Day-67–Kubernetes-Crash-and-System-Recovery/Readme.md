# Day 68 – Kubernetes Crash and System Recovery

## What I Did
- Faced a complete system crash while working with Kubernetes clusters.
- Investigated potential reasons such as resource overload or misconfiguration.
- Attempted OS-level recovery to restore normal functionality.
- Prepared for a complete operating system reinstall if required.
- Backed up important files before performing any major changes.
- Planned a clean Kubernetes setup once the system is restored.

## Learnings
- Kubernetes can consume significant resources and may destabilize low-spec systems.
- System crashes are a natural part of DevOps experimentation.
- Recovery skills are essential for maintaining reliable environments.
- Backups ensure safe recovery during unexpected failures.
- A clean OS reinstall can sometimes be the quickest fix.
