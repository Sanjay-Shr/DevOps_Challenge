# Flask To-Do App with Makefile Automation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Makefiles** to automate the setup and execution of a **Flask To-Do application**. Using a Makefile, repetitive tasks like creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running the app can be simplified into single commands.

---

## What I Did

- Set up a Makefile to automate project setup and execution
- Created targets like `setup`, `run`, and `clean`
- Linked commands to install dependencies, activate virtual environments, and start the Flask app
- Learned basic error handling within Makefile commands

---

## What I Learnt

- The purpose of Makefiles in DevOps and project automation
- How to reduce repetitive manual steps and save time
- Proper syntax for writing targets, dependencies, and commands in a Makefile
- How automation helps make projects reproducible and easier to share

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Automation is powerful:** A single command like `make setup` can replace multiple manual steps
- **Clean project workflows:** Using Makefiles ensures consistency across different environments
- **Reproducibility:** Anyone cloning the repo can get started with minimal setup
- **DevOps mindset:** Learning small tools like Makefiles builds the foundation for more complex CI/CD pipelines
