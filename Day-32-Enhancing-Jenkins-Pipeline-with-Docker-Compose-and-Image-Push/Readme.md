# Day 32 – Enhancing Jenkins Pipeline with Docker Compose and Image Push

## Overview
On Day 31, I focused on enhancing my Jenkins pipeline by introducing production-level steps using Docker Compose.  
Previously, the pipeline handled Docker builds, but now I am automating container orchestration and preparing for image push to Docker Hub.

## What I Did
- Replaced the basic Docker build command with `docker compose up -d` for multi-container deployment.  
- Added new pipeline stages to handle Docker image tagging and pushing to Docker Hub.  
- Configured Docker credentials in Jenkins for secure registry authentication.  
- Faced multiple pipeline errors related to credentials, image naming, and permission issues.  
- Performed detailed troubleshooting, analyzing logs, and refining Jenkinsfile syntax.

## Learnings
- Transitioning from single builds to Compose setups mirrors real-world CI/CD pipelines.  
- Credential and permission handling are critical when working with Docker registries.  
- Troubleshooting builds improves understanding of Jenkins’ integration with external tools.

## Next Steps
- Fix the current pipeline issues and achieve a successful Docker Hub image push.  
- Extend the pipeline to include automated testing and deployment verification.
