# Day 29 | Jenkins Integration with GitHub

## Overview
On Day 29, I focused on connecting Jenkins with GitHub to enable automated builds and continuous integration whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This step is crucial for streamlining CI/CD workflows and ensuring smooth code delivery pipelines.

## What I Did
- Configured GitHub credentials within Jenkins for secure authentication.  
- Installed and set up the **GitHub Integration Plugin** in Jenkins.  
- Generated a **GitHub Personal Access Token** and added it to Jenkins credentials.  
- Created a **new Jenkins pipeline job** that automatically triggers on every code push to the repository.  
- Verified successful synchronization between Jenkins and GitHub and ensured builds were triggered automatically.

## What I Learned
- How Jenkins and GitHub work together to automate CI/CD workflows.  
- The importance of **webhooks** in enabling real-time build triggers.  
- How to manage credentials securely within Jenkins for repository access.  
- The value of continuous integration in improving code quality and developer productivity.

## Key Takeaways
- Jenkinsâ€“GitHub integration forms the backbone of modern DevOps automation.  
- Webhooks help eliminate manual triggers and ensure faster feedback loops.  
- Proper credential setup ensures both security and automation efficiency.  
- Each successful integration step builds confidence toward full CI/CD mastery.
