# Day 52 — Starting the Django + NGINX + MySQL Project Setup

## Overview
Today marks the beginning of my multi-container project using Django, NGINX, and MySQL. The focus was on preparing the complete project structure and ensuring all base components are properly defined before starting the deeper development work.

## What I Did Today
- Structured the project layout for the Django Notes App.
- Wrote the Dockerfile for the Django backend from scratch.
- Created the `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate NGINX, Django, and MySQL.
- Set up folders for backend code, NGINX configuration, and database volumes.
- Planned out service-to-service communication using Docker networks.
- Reviewed how each component will interact once the stack is fully running.

## Learnings
- Importance of designing the architecture before implementation.
- Better understanding of multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose.
- Clarity on how Django, MySQL, and NGINX fit together in a real deployment flow.
- Reinforced knowledge of Dockerfile structure and compose configurations.
