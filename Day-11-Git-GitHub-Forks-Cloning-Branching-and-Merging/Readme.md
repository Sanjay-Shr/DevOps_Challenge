# Day 11 | DevOps Challenge - Git/GitHub core topics

Today, I dove deeper into Git basics, focusing on collaboration and branching which is such a crucial part of version control. Here’s what I worked on:

1. **Forking vs Cloning**  
   - Learned the difference between forking a repo and cloning it locally.  
   - Important to know when working with open-source or collaborative projects.  

2. **Syncing with GitHub**  
   - Used `git pull origin main` to sync my local repo with the changes from GitHub.  
   - Helps keep everything up-to-date.  

3. **Branching**  
   - Explored how branches work in Git.  
   - Checked branches: `git branch`  
   - Created new branch: `git checkout -B dev`  
   - Switched between `main` and `dev` to see how each branch maintains its own version.  

4. **Working with Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - Pushed a new folder to the `dev` branch.  
   - Raised a PR to merge it into `main`.  
   - Merged the PR → saw the changes appear in `main`.  
   - Learned why PRs are such a safe way to handle changes!  

5. **Commit History**  
   - Viewed commit history using:  
     - `git log`  
     - `git log --oneline` (clean list of commits).  

6. **Fetching Branches**  
   - Learned how to fetch a branch that isn’t available locally using:  
     - `git fetch`
