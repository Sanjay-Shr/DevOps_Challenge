# Day 20 | Networking for DevOps — IP, DNS, NAT, Firewall & Nginx Hosting

## Overview
Today, I explored some of the most critical components that make networking work in real-world DevOps environments. I focused on IP addressing, subnets, DNS, NAT, and firewalls — and then applied my learning by hosting a website locally using Nginx on port 80.

## What I Did
- Learned about **IP addressing** and **subnetting** to understand how devices communicate within and across networks
- Understood how **DNS** maps domain names to IP addresses
- Explored **NAT (Network Address Translation)** and **firewalls** for secure network communication
- Installed and configured **Nginx**, hosted a static website, and accessed it through the browser using port 80

## What I Learned
- IP and subnetting are foundational for organizing and managing network traffic
- DNS is essential for resolving domain names and ensuring accessibility
- NAT and firewalls ensure security and proper routing of data between private and public networks
- Nginx plays a key role as a web server and reverse proxy in DevOps environments

## Key Takeaways
- Networking concepts like IP, DNS, and NAT are not just theoretical — they directly apply to real-world infrastructure
- Hosting a site locally using Nginx bridges theory with practice
- Understanding these basics is vital before diving into container, cloud, and CI/CD networking setups
