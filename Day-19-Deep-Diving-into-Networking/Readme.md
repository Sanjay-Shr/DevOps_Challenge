# Day 19 | Deep Diving into Networking for DevOps

## Overview
Today marks the beginning of my deep dive into **Networking**, one of the most essential areas in DevOps. Understanding how systems communicate, exchange data, and interact across different layers forms the backbone of automation, deployment, and cloud management.

## What I Did
- Started learning the **OSI Model** and **TCP/IP Model**
- Understood how data flows through each layer â€” from physical connections to application-level communication
- Explored the relationship between these models and real-world DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS networking

## What I Learned
- The OSI model helps visualize how communication occurs between systems in a structured way
- The TCP/IP model maps directly to practical implementations used in the internet and cloud
- Networking knowledge is critical for managing **containers, cloud instances, and automation pipelines**

## Key Takeaways
- Networking is the backbone of all DevOps and cloud operations
- Understanding communication layers helps troubleshoot and optimize infrastructure
- Strong networking fundamentals lead to better decisions in designing scalable and secure systems

## Next Steps
Continue exploring key networking topics like IP addressing, DNS, subnets, routing, and load balancing in real-world DevOps environments.
