# Day 25 | DevOps Challenge — Jenkins Pipeline Basics

Today, I continued exploring Jenkins and focused on understanding how pipelines work — one of the most powerful automation features in Jenkins.

## What I Did
- Accessed the Jenkins dashboard and created a **new item** by selecting the **Pipeline** option.
- Added a meaningful **description** and wrote a demo pipeline script with multiple stages.
- Configured the pipeline to automatically create a folder and a file as part of the process.
- Saved the job and executed the **build**, which ran successfully without any errors.
- Observed how each stage executes in sequence, providing clear visibility of the workflow.

## Key Learnings
- Jenkins Pipelines provide a **structured, stage-by-stage automation** approach for CI/CD workflows.
- Each stage represents a defined process such as build, test, or deploy.
- A successful pipeline execution ensures proper setup and marks the start of advanced automation.
- This hands-on experience helped me understand how Jenkins transitions from freestyle jobs to pipelines for better scalability and control.

## Next Step
Moving ahead, I plan to create more complex pipelines and integrate them with Git repositories for real-world CI/CD automation.
