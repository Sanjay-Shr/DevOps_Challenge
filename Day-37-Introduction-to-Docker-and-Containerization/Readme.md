# Day 37 – Introduction to Docker and Containerization

## Overview
On Day 37, I began learning about **Docker**, its origins, and how it revolutionized modern application deployment through containerization.  
Docker was developed by **DotCloud** to solve a recurring problem — environment inconsistency between systems.

## What I Did
- Learned Docker’s history and evolution from DotCloud to an open-source containerization platform.  
- Understood the problem of “It works on my machine” that led to the birth of Docker.  
- Explored the concept of **Containerization** and its difference from **Virtualization**.  
- Studied how Virtual Machines use **hypervisors** and separate OS instances.  
- Learned how Docker uses the **host OS kernel**, making containers lightweight and faster to start.  

## Learnings
- **Virtualization vs Containerization**:
  - Virtualization uses hypervisors to create multiple virtual machines, each with its own OS.
  - Containerization uses Docker Engine, sharing the host OS kernel for lightweight execution.  
- Docker containers are faster, more portable, and consume fewer resources compared to VMs.  
- Containerization simplifies deployment and enhances consistency across environments.  

## Next Steps
- Install Docker and explore its CLI commands.  
- Create my first Docker container and understand Docker images.
