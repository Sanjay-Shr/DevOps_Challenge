# Day 13 — Shell Scripting Basics

Today, I started learning **Shell Scripting**, one of the most powerful automation tools in Linux.  
It’s the foundation for automating repetitive tasks, managing systems efficiently, and creating real-world DevOps workflows.

## What I Learned

### Linux Architecture
- Understood how the **Kernel**, **Shell**, **Hardware**, and **User Space** interact.
- Realized how Shell acts as a bridge between users and the operating system.

### Setting Up the Environment
- Created a working directory named `Day-13-Shell-Scripting-Basics`.
- Created a simple shell script `hello.sh`.
- Made the file executable using `chmod +x hello.sh`.
- Executed the script with `./hello.sh`.

### Core Shell Scripting Concepts
- **Variables:** Learned to store and use data dynamically inside scripts.
- **Comments:** Practiced both single-line and multi-line comments for better readability.
- **Arguments:** Passed values dynamically while running scripts.
- **Conditions:** Used `if-else` statements for decision-making.
- **Loops:** Explored both `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks automatically.

### Practical Examples
- Created and executed scripts such as:
  - `demo.sh`
  - `conditiondemo.sh`
  - `loopsdemo.sh`
  - `whiloop.sh`
- Automated file creation and deletion using loops (`file_1` to `file_10`).
- Practiced setting and verifying file permissions (`chmod 755`, `chmod +x`).

## Key Takeaway
Shell scripting is the **heart of Linux automation** — it teaches the system to act on its own.  
Even a few lines of script can perform complex operations, save hours of manual effort, and form the base of real DevOps automation.
