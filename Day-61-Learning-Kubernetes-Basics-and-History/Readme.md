# Day 61 – Learning Kubernetes Basics and History

## Overview
Today I began my Kubernetes journey by understanding its history, purpose, and why it became the most widely used container orchestration platform.

---

## What I Learned Today (Point-Wise)
- Explored the problems faced before Kubernetes, especially scaling issues and manual service recovery.
- Learned about **Google Borg**, the internal tool created in 2014 that introduced:
  - Auto-healing  
  - Auto-scaling  
  - Resource efficiency  
  - Container orchestration at massive scale
- Understood that **Kubernetes is inspired by Borg** and later made open-source.
- Learned that Kubernetes is an **orchestration platform** for managing multiple containers.
- Understood why the term **K8s** is used (8 letters between K and s).
- Understood Kubernetes' core responsibility: ensuring the desired state of applications.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Kubernetes automates container management across clusters.
- Borg was the predecessor to Kubernetes, built by Google.
- Orchestration tools are essential in microservices and multi-container environments.
- Kubernetes ensures high availability through self-healing and auto-scaling.
- This marks the starting point of hands-on Kubernetes learning.
