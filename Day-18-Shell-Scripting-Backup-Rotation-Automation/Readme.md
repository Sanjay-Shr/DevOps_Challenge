# Day 18 | DevOps Challenge - Backup & Rotation Automation

## Overview
Today, I focused on understanding how backups and file rotation are managed in real-world systems by setting up a simulated production environment on my local Linux machine. My goal was to automate the backup of critical files and efficiently manage storage.

---

## What I Did
1. Wrote a shell script to automate the backup of a key directory.  
2. Implemented a 5-day backup rotation system to delete old backups automatically and free up storage.  
3. Scheduled the backup script to run at regular intervals using **crontab**, ensuring that it operates without manual intervention.  
4. Tested the setup locally to verify that both the backup and rotation were functioning correctly.

## What I Learned
1. The importance of having a **backup rotation strategy** to optimize storage in production systems.  
2. How to use **crontab** to automate recurring tasks on a Linux system.  
3. The value of structuring shell scripts with **functions**, proper **error handling**, and **logging**.  
4. How simple automation scripts can simulate real-world DevOps tasks and workflows.

## Key Takeaways
1. Backups are not just about saving data; **managing them efficiently** is equally crucial.  
2. **Automation** enhances reliability and ensures consistency.  
3. Even small automation tasks contribute significantly to mastering the skills needed for real-world **DevOps problem-solving**.
